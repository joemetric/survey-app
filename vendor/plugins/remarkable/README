== Description

Remarkable is a framework for rspec matchers that supports macros and I18n. It's
constituted of three pieces:

* Remarkable: the framework with helpers, DSL, I18n and rspec features;

* Remarkable ActiveRecord: a collection of matchers for ActiveRecord. It
  supports all ActiveRecord validations, associations and some extra matchers.

* Remarkable Rails: a collection of matchers for ActionController. It also
  includes MacroStubs, which is a clean DSL for stubbing your controller methods.

In each folder above, you can find a README more detailed description of each piece.

== Why use Remarkable for Rails?

* The only one with matchers for all ActiveRecord validations, with support to
  all options (except :on and the option :with in validates_format_of);

* Matchers for all ActiveRecord associations. The only one which supports all
  these options:

    :through, :source, :source_type, :class_name, :foreign_key, :dependent,
    :join_table, :uniq, :readonly, :validate, :autosave, :counter_cache, :polymorphic

  Plus SQL options:

    :select, :conditions, :include, :group, :having, :order, :limit, :offset

  Besides in Remarkable 3.0 matchers became much smarter. Whenever :join_table
  or :through is given as option, it checks if the given table exists. Whenever
  :foreign_key or :counter_cache is given, it checks if the given column exists;

* ActionController matchers:

    :assign_to, :filter_params, :redirect_to, :render_with_layout, :respond_with, 
    :render_template, :route, :set_session and :set_the_flash;

* Macro stubs: make your controllers specs easier to main, more readable and DRY;

* Tests and more tests. We have a huge tests suite ready to run and tested in
  Rails 2.1.2, 2.2.2 and 2.3.2;

* I18n and great documentation.

* It has your style. You can choose between:

    1) it { should validate_numericality_of(:age).greater_than(18).only_integer }

    2) it { should validate_numericality_of(:age, :greater_than => 18, :only_integer => true) }

    3) should_validate_numericality_of :age, :greater_than => 18, :only_integer => true

    4) should_validate_numericality_of :age do |m|
         m.only_integer
         m.greater_than 18
         # Or: m.greater_than = 18
       end

Remarkable Rails requires rspec >= 1.2.0 and rspec-rails >= 1.2.0.

== Install on Rails

Install the gem:

  sudo gem install remarkable_rails

This will install remarkable, remarkable_activerecord and remarkable_rails gems.

Inside Rails you need to require just this gem. If you are using ActiveRecord,
it will automatically require the remarkable_activerecord gem.

== Rails 2.3

In Rails 2.3, in order to rspec load properly, you have to use this configuration
on your config/environments/test.rb

  config.gem "rspec",            :lib => false
  config.gem "rspec-rails",      :lib => false
  config.gem "remarkable_rails", :lib => false

And then require remarkable inside your spec_helper.rb, after "spec/rails":

  require 'spec/rails'
  require 'remarkable_rails'

This is the safest way to avoid conflicts.

Users who are upgrading to Remarkable 3.0, should not find any problem if their
tests are running without deprecation warnings.

== Developers

If you are developing matchers, for example hpricot matchers, you need to install
only the remarkable "core" gem:

  sudo gem install remarkable

If you stumble into any problem or have doubts while building your matchers,
please drop us a line. We are currently searching for people who wants to join
us and provide matchers for Datamapper, Sequel, Sinatra and all other possible
options. :)
