= Remarkable I18n

This folder contains remarkable translations in several languages.

== How to I18n my specs

Inside your spec helper do:

   Remarkable.add_locale "path/to/my_locale.yml"
   Remarkable.locale = :my_locale

If you are using Remarkable with Rails, you can place the locale file inside
you config/locales folder and then you can skip the first line.
