  module ActionController

    # Macro stubs makes stubs and expectations easier, more readable and DRY.
    #
    # == Example
    #
    # Let's jump off to an example:
    #
    #   describe ProjectsController do
    #     describe :get => :show, :id => 37 do
    #       expects :find, :on => Project, :with => '37', :returns => proc { mock_project }
    #
    #       should_assign_to :project, :with => proc { mock_project }
    #       should_render_template 'show'
    #
    #       describe Mime::XML do
    #         should_assign_to :project
    #         should_respond_with_content_type Mime::XML
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # See how the spec is readable: a ProjectsController responding to get show
    # expects :find on Project which a mock project and then should assign to
    # project and render template 'show'.
    #
    # Each macro before asserting will check if an action was already performed and
    # if not, it runs the expectations and call the action.
    #
    # In other words, should assign to macro is basically doing:
    #
    #   it 'should assign to project' do
    #     Project.should_receive(:find).with('37').and_return(mock_project)
    #     get :show, :id => '37'
    #     assigns(:project).should == mock_project
    #   end
    #
    # By default, all macros perform expectations. You can change
    # this behavior sending :with_stubs or :with_expectations as options:
    #
    #   should_assign_to       :project, :with_stubs => true
    #   should_render_template 'show', :with_expectations => false
    #
    # This also works in the rspec way:
    #
    #   it { should assign_to(:project).with_stubs                   }
    #   it { should render_template('show').with_expectations(false) }
    #
    # == Attention!
    #
    # If you need to check that an array is being sent to a method, you need to
    # give an array inside another array, for example:
    #
    #   expects :comment_ids=, :on => Post, :with => [1,2,3]
    #
    # Is the same as:
    #
    #   Post.comment_ids = (1, 2, 3)
    #
    # And it won't work. The right way to handle this is:
    #
    #   expects :comment_ids=, :on => Post, :with => [[1,2,3]]
    #
    # == mock_models
    #
    # You don't have to play with proc all the time. You can call mock_models which
    # creates two class methods that simply returns a proc and a instance method that
    # do the actual mock.
    #
    #   describe ProjectsController do
    #     mock_models :project
    #
    # And it creates:
    #
    #   def self.project_proc
    #     proc { mock_project }
    #   end
    #
    #   # To be used on index actions
    #   def self.projects_proc
    #     proc { [mock_project] }
    #   end
    #
    #   def mock_project(stubs={})
    #     @project ||= mock_model(Project, stubs)
    #   end
    #
    # Then you can replace those lines:
    #
    #    expects :find, :on => Project, :with => '37', :returns => proc { mock_project }
    #    should_assign_to :project, :with => proc { mock_project }
    #
    # For:
    #
    #    expects :find, :on => Project, :with => '37', :returns => project_proc
    #    should_assign_to :project, :with => project_proc
    #
    # = Give me more!
    #
    # If you need to set the example group description, you can also call <tt>get</tt>,
    # <tt>post</tt>, <tt>put</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> methods:
    #
    #   describe 'my description' do
    #     get :show, :id => 37
    #
    # Things start to get even better when we start to talk about nested resources.
    # After our ProjectsController is created, we want to create a TasksController:
    #
    #   describe TasksController do
    #     params :project_id => '42' #=> define params for all requests
    #
    #     # Those two expectations get inherited in all describe groups below
    #     expects :find_by_title, :on => Project, :with => '42', :returns => project_proc
    #     expects :tasks, :and_return => Task
    #
    #     describe :get => :show, :id => '37' do
    #       expects :find, :with => '37', :and_return => task_proc
    #
    #       should_assign_to :project, :task
    #       should_render_template 'show'
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # As you noticed, you can define parameters that will be available to all requests,
    # using the method <tt>params</tt>.
    #
    # Finally if you need to write a spec by hand, you can invoke the action and
    # expectations with run_action!, run_expectations! and run_stubs!. Examples:
    #
    #   describe :get => :new do
    #     expects :new, :on => Project, :returns => project_proc
    #
    #     it "should do something different" do
    #       run_action!
    #       # do you assertions here
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # = Performance!
    #
    # Remarkable comes with a new way to speed up your tests. It performs the
    # action inside a before(:all), so you can do:
    #
    #   describe "responding to GET show" do
    #     get! :show, :id => 37
    #
    #     should_assign_to :task
    #     should_render_template :show
    #   end
    #
    # Or in the compact way:
    #
    #   describe :get! => :show, :id => 37
    #
    # The action will be performed just once before running the macros. If any
    # error happens while performing the action, rspec will output an error
    # but ALL the examples inside the example group (describe) won't be run.
    #
    # By now, the bang methods works only when integrate_views is true and this
    # is when you must see a bigger performance gain.
    #
    # This feature comes with some rspec and rspec rails tweakings. So if you want
    # to do something before the action is performed (stubs something or log
    # someone in session), you have to do it giving a block to the action method:
    #
    #   get! :show, :id => 37 do
    #     login_as(mock_user)
    #   end
    #
    # You can still use the compact way and give the block:
    #
    #   describe :get => :show, :id => 37 do
    #     get! do
    #       login_as(mock_user)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
