Hi,

BackgrounDRb 1.2 is being unleashed.

* New features:

** Exceptions/errors are now popped out at the earliest moment
  in the client side itself. For example:

>> MiddleMan.worker(:foo_worker).async_bar(:args => {:age => 10})
BackgrounDRb::RemoteWorkerError: BackgrounDRb::RemoteWorkerError

  Above exception is thrown because remote worker doesn't have method
  "bar" defined on it.

Similarly:

>> MiddleMan.worker(:foo_worker).checksum(:args => {:age => "lolz"})
BackgrounDRb::RemoteWorkerError: BackgrounDRb::RemoteWorkerError

  Above exception is thrown because remote worker's checksum method
  expects an integer as an argument.

  For asynchronous method calls, BackgrounDRb doesn't check if method
  ran successfully, it only checks existence of methods on remote
  worker. For sync method calls it checks if method ran successfully
  or not.

** Its possible to have per worker configuration options now.

* Bug Fixes

** Much better error/exception handling. Rogue worker methods shouldn't
   crash the worker now. All the unhandled exceptions and dispatch
   errors can be found in debug log file.

** Fixes for postgres db with persistent job queues.

** Switched to lightweight Queue implementation for tasks enqueued
   to thread pool.

** Fixes for database dropped connections while running tasks from
   persistent queues.

** Fixes for newer Rails versions.

**
